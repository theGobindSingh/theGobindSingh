 I enjoy creating things that live on the internet; A developer & geek from India, who loves MCU and Anime. I'm currently an intern in Bajaj Finserv Health as a Web Developer. I have previously worked with a startup and a software development company. I try my best to pour life into ideas and bring them to the relm of reality. In the digital world, knowledge is infinite. I wish to keep on learning and practice everyday, but most importantly, I love working with diverse people.
