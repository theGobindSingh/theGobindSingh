## 👨‍💻 About Me

I’m a software engineer who builds production-grade web systems with a strong focus on frontend architecture, performance, and long-term maintainability.

Over the years, I’ve worked across early-stage startups, AI-driven platforms, and large enterprise systems. That range forced me to think beyond just writing components and focus on system design, scalability, release workflows, and developer experience. I’ve built interfaces used daily by real teams, optimized large codebases, and shipped features where stability actually mattered.

I care deeply about how software ages. Clean abstractions, predictable data flows, and performance at scale matter more to me than quick hacks. Whether it’s frontend architecture, design systems, or backend APIs, I try to build things that don’t collapse six months later.

Outside of engineering, I value continuous learning, clear communication, and working with people who challenge my thinking. Good software, to me, is simple on the surface, solid underneath, and boring to maintain.
